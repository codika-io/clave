# Clave

Mac desktop app for managing multiple coding-agent CLI sessions in parallel. Provider-agnostic: it orchestrates Claude Code (Cmd+N), Antigravity CLI (Cmd+I), and Codex CLI (Cmd+U) sessions side by side, plus plain terminals (Cmd+T) and remote agents over OpenClaw. Electron + React + TypeScript.

Clave's companion agent plugin (`clave`, exposing `/clave:create-workspace` and `/clave:recover-sessions`) ships from `plugin/` in this repo — see `plugin/CLAUDE.md`. It is installed with `npx plugins add codika-io/clave`, resolved through `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the root. The Electron app reads installed plugins from `~/.claude/plugins/` at runtime and never reads `plugin/` directly; the folder is here so a `.clave` format change and the skill that describes it land in the same commit (see the schema sync rule below).

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev (Electron window + hot reload)
- `npm run build` — typecheck + build
- `npm run build:mac` — build + package macOS universal dmg + zip (signed + notarized)
- `npm run typecheck` — typecheck only
- `npm run lint` — eslint
- Releases ship via CI on push to `prod` (bump from a `[minor]`/`[major]` commit-message marker, else patch) — see `.claude/rules/release.md`. `npm run release -- --patch|--minor|--major` remains the local fallback.

## Architecture

Three-process Electron app:

- **Main** (`src/main/`): Electron window, node-pty, IPC handlers, domain managers. PTY spawns `/bin/zsh -l -c claude` per session. IPC handlers are split into modular files under `ipc-handlers/`.
- **Preload** (`src/preload/`): Typed `window.electronAPI` via contextBridge. All main↔renderer communication goes through IPC.
- **Renderer** (`src/renderer/src/`): React + Zustand + xterm.js + Tailwind v4 + Framer Motion.

**Windows** (PRDCT-1703): a window is the whole app once more, on whatever workspace the user put it on — several windows may show the same workspace. One main process, one MCP server, one pty-manager, one event store; each window is a renderer with its own Zustand stores. Sessions and groups live in the window they were opened in, and that is all "which window" means: every window has a persisted `windowKey` (`windows.json`, `src/main/window-state.ts`), its own sidebar layout file (`sidebar-layouts/windows/<key>.json`), and session records carry the key of their home window. The runtime truth (window ↔ key ↔ workspace, session → window) is `src/main/window-registry.ts`; the lowest-id live window is the *primary*: it adopts orphans at boot (records and layouts whose window no longer exists) and takes in what a closing window leaves (its tmux-backed tabs re-home there with their groups, ids preserved). Moving a tab or a group between windows is the same detach + re-adopt (`window:move-sessions` / `window:move-group`), and the agent tools take a `window` argument for it. A call from an agent lands in the window holding its subject session, else the window it names, else the caller's window — never a window picked from the `workspace` argument.

## Conventions

- **Icons**: Use Heroicons (`@heroicons/react/24/outline`) for all UI icons. No hand-rolled SVGs for standard icons. Custom SVGs only for file-type icons in `components/files/file-icons.tsx`.
- **`.clave` schema sync rule**: the schema is mirrored in **six** places that do NOT import each other. When you change an enum — or add, rename, or remove ANY `.clave` field — all six move in the same change:
  1. `src/renderer/src/store/session-types.ts` — the renderer types (`GroupTerminalIcon`, `TERMINAL_COLOR_VALUES`, `PinnedGroup`, `PinnedGroupSession`, `PinnedGroupTerminal`, `SessionGroup`).
  2. `src/main/ipc-handlers/clave-trust.ts` — the file shape (`ClaveGroupData`, `ClaveFileReadResult`) **and the trust boundary**, `describeElevated` / `sanitizeElevated`. Any field that can drive an agent — a prompt, an auto-run command, a permissions flag — must be added to BOTH functions or an untrusted `.clave` gets it past the review dialog with no symptom at all. This is the security-critical mirror; `clave-trust-boundary.test.ts` is the test that must grow with it.
  3. `src/main/ipc-handlers/clave-file-handlers.ts` — the main-process parser and writer (`ClaveFileRaw`, `ClaveFileWriteData`, `resolveGroup`, `serializeGroup`), plus the wiring that decides whether to consult the trust boundary at all (`isUnderTrustedRoot`, the elevated check, the dialog answers).
  4. `src/preload/index.d.ts` — the typed IPC boundary (`ClaveFileGroupData`, `ClaveFileWriteData`). Easy to miss because nothing references it by name, and the read path silently loses the field if it lags.
  5. `src/main/mcp/mcp-server.ts` — the MCP tool schemas agents call.
  6. `plugin/skills/create-workspace/SKILL.md` — the reference agents author `.clave` files from. A stale skill fails silently: it keeps writing the field you renamed, and the `.clave` still parses. It used to live in a separate repo and need its own PR; it is in this repo precisely so it can go in the same commit as the other five.

  Then check the round-trip, which is where a new field actually goes missing: `resolveGroup` (read), the sync writer and `exportClaveFile` in `pinned-store.ts` (write), `createPinnedFromGroup` AND `pinGroupFromCurrent` (both directions of pin ↔ live group), and **both single-group normalisations in `pinned-store.ts`** — one in `importClaveFile`, one in the file watcher's reload, each rebuilding the object field by field. They are easy to mistake for one another: during PRDCT-1665 the import copy dropped a new field twice, and the watcher copy dropped it in a way that made a `.clave` edit never hot-reload.

  Nothing here fails loudly. Unknown icons fall back to the default, unknown colors render colorless, and a dropped field simply is not there — the feature demos perfectly in the UI and does nothing. Verify a new field by inspecting the spawned process or the written file, not the rendering.
- **Themes**: Three themes (dark, light, coffee). CSS vars on `:root` / `[data-theme="light"]` / `[data-theme="coffee"]` in `main.css`. xterm has separate theme objects updated via `terminal.options.theme`.
- **Type**: Geist Sans is the app, everywhere, via `--font-sans`, and it is the ONLY face the app ships. The `Clave` wordmark beside the traffic lights looks like a second one but is not: it is Sentient Light **outlined into SVG paths** (`components/layout/Wordmark.tsx`, which carries the regeneration recipe). ⚠️ **Never bundle the Sentient file.** It is Fontshare's, under the ITF Free Font Licence — free to use, including in a logo, and NOT free to redistribute as a file — and this repo is public and ships a packaged app through GitHub Releases, so a `.woff2` in the asar is redistribution. An outline is drawing, not type. Same call and same reasoning as the website's outlined "Antasphere" (`company/website/apps/website/src/brand/assets.ts`); read that before touching this. `tests/e2e/sidebar-foot.spec.mjs` fails if a Sentient face is ever registered again or if anything on the page asks for one.
- **The brand field**: `lib/brand-field.ts` is the Antasphere generative field — gradient, veil, film grain — ported from `company/website/apps/website/src/brand/engine.ts`, itself a port of the brand console's engine. It is the material behind the user's avatar and the ground of the sidebar's foot panel (`BrandField`, `UserIconDisplay`, `SidebarFooter`). Its `PALETTES` table and the `GRAIN` constant are MIRRORED from the console, not owned here: when the house changes a palette or the grain, change it in this file too. Three rules the paint depends on, each of which fails as "it looks a bit flat" rather than as an error:
  1. Compose at a working resolution and scale down. The blur is a fraction of the width, so blurring at a 32px target is a quarter-tile blur and every palette becomes the same brown-grey mush.
  2. **Quieten a field with `groundLift`, never with CSS opacity.** Fading the finished canvas fades the grain with it and leaves a grey smear; `groundLift` washes the app's own surface over the GRADIENT and lets the grain land at full strength after — the website's ground reads the way it does because the gradient is barely there and the noise is loud. The veil alpha is solved from the field's measured luminance, not fixed, so near-black Basalt and near-white Glacier land the same distance off the app's surface and differ only in hue.
  3. Pick the film's composite arm from the ground the grain actually lands on, not from the palette's `light` flag. Once veiled, that flag describes a picture that is no longer there — a pale palette on a dark app took the light arm and lifted the whole panel into smoke.
- **Usage**: `store/usage-store.ts` is the one fetch of the Claude rate-limit windows for the whole renderer; the sidebar's foot and the Usage settings pane both read it, so one request serves both and the pane's refresh button moves the foot too. `tightestWindow()` is the auto-detection — nothing names a cap, because which caps an account has is the service's business (session block, weekly all-models, one per model, whatever it adds next); it picks whichever came back is closest to stopping you, severity first. The foot shows percent **LEFT**, and `tests/e2e/sidebar-foot.spec.mjs` cross-checks it against the pane's percent-used so the two can never disagree by exactly that inversion.
- **Stores**: Zustand stores in `src/renderer/src/store/`. `session-store.ts` is the main one (sessions, groups, layout, theme).
- **Design system**: read **`BRAND.md`** before writing ANY UI — it is the field guide to the system (which button class goes in which box, the token scales, the two rules that make utilities silently lose to system classes). The classes themselves live in `main.css` (`sidebar-item`, `panel-icon-btn`, `btn-primary`, `btn-dialog`, `btn-icon`, `input-field`, `menu-surface`, etc.) and are the single source of truth for spacing, radius, shadows, and interactive states. Never duplicate styling logic across components; when adding new UI, check `main.css` for an existing class first, and if none fits, extend the design system with a new semantic class rather than inlining styles.

## Signing and notarization

Builds require Apple code signing. Credentials in `.env` (not committed):
- `CSC_LINK` — base64-encoded .p12 certificate
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` — certificate password
- `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` — for notarization

## Gotchas

- **PATH resolution in packaged app (CRITICAL)**: Packaged Electron apps have a minimal PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`). The user's full PATH must be resolved by spawning a login shell. **NEVER use `execSync`** — it goes through `/bin/sh` which expands `$PATH` before zsh starts. Always use `execFileSync('/bin/zsh', ['-lic', 'echo __PATH__$PATH'])` so zsh sources `.zprofile`/`.zshrc` first. This is the root cause of `command not found: claude` in packaged builds.
- **electron-updater targets**: Both `zip` and `dmg` targets are required in `electron-builder.yml` — zip for silent background updates, dmg for fresh installs.
- **Repo must be public** for electron-updater to check GitHub Releases without an auth token.
- **node-pty spawn-helper** needs +x permissions — handled by `postinstall` script.
- **No WebGL**: WebGL addon for xterm was removed (context loss issues) — canvas renderer only.
- **macOS traffic lights**: `trafficLightPosition: { x: 16, y: 18 }` with `hiddenInset` titlebar, and ONLY on darwin — Windows and Linux keep a native frame with their controls above our content. Two pieces of chrome hold clearance for the buttons, both asking `useTrafficLights()` (darwin AND not fullscreen, never `!fullScreen` alone): the sidebar's `WordmarkStrip` (90px, dropping to the 16px gutter when they are absent) and the toolbar row (`pl-[4.75rem]`, with the sidebar closed).
- **Terminal fit**: ResizeObserver guards against zero-size during animations; `FitAddon.fit()` wrapped in try/catch.

## Rules

- When using the Playwright MCP server to take screenshots, always delete the screenshot files after you are done using them.
- After implementing UI or renderer changes, always verify them with the **Playwright Electron MCP** (not the regular Playwright MCP). This launches the real Electron app with full `window.electronAPI` support.
- **NEVER use `pkill`, `killall`, or broad process-matching commands** to kill test Electron instances — these will also kill the user's installed Clave app.

### Playwright Electron MCP — Verification workflow

Config: `.playwright-electron.config.json` (gitignored). Launches the built Electron app directly with an isolated `--user-data-dir` to avoid conflicts with the running installed Clave app. The engineering plugin's `.mcp.json` passes `--config .playwright-electron.config.json` so this file is actually loaded by the MCP server.

1. Build: `npx electron-vite build` (compiles to `out/`)
2. Load tools: `ToolSearch` for `+playwright-electron`
3. Launch: `electron_first_window`
4. Inspect: `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_console_messages`
5. Cleanup: `browser_close`, then delete any screenshot files

The regular `playwright` MCP opens `localhost:5173` in Chrome where `window.electronAPI` is undefined — useless for testing Electron features.

**A verification script MUST be able to fail.** Assert and exit non-zero; a script that prints JSON for a human to read and exits 0 unconditionally is a probe, not a check, and it verifies nothing the moment nobody is reading. The test: mutate the behaviour the script covers, re-run it, and confirm it goes red. If it stays green, the script is decoration. This is not hypothetical — PRDCT-1663/1664/1665 shipped seven print-only scripts that survived 9 of 9 targeted mutations, including one that disabled prompt sanitization for untrusted `.clave` files, and two of them had been broken since the commit was written because they selected a `title` that same commit deleted.

If the Playwright Electron MCP is unavailable (see PRDCT-1669 — its config is gitignored, so a fresh clone or worktree has none and the server exits before registering a tool), drive the app directly with Playwright's `_electron` API: `electron.launch({ executablePath: 'node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron', args: ['.', '--user-data-dir=<isolated>'], cwd: <repo> })`. Same fidelity — real Electron, real `window.electronAPI`.

**`--test-no-activate`** (`src/main/test-mode.ts`) is the main-process flag that stops a test instance stealing the machine's focus or its screen: macOS accessory policy, no Dock icon, and NO window ever shown (`showInactive()` was not enough — a new window still lands at the front of the desktop, over the human's work), with `backgroundThrottling: false` so the hidden renderer keeps its timers and animation frames. `tests/e2e/harness.mjs` passes it on every launch, so under E2E `BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()` can be null, `win.isFocused()` and `win.isVisible()` false — assert Clave-internal focus, never the window manager's, and never a window on screen. It defaults off and off it changes nothing. Ledger: when a test instance quits, macOS may still hand activation to another running app; that is the desktop's doing, not the app's.

# Clave UI conventions — the field guide

Read this before writing any UI. It exists because a whole feature's buttons were
rebuilt three times against the wrong references: first improvised sizes, then the
toolbar's, before landing on the panel family that was the actual standard. Every
value here is a class or token that already exists in
`src/renderer/src/assets/main.css` — this file tells you which one to reach for.
When something you need is missing there, extend `main.css` with a new semantic
class next to its family; never inline the styling at the call site.

## The two rules that beat everything else

1. **The design system is unlayered; Tailwind utilities are layered.** A dimension,
   color, or padding set by a design-system class BEATS `w-5`, `text-accent`,
   `pr-2` on the same element. Do not "fix" a system class with a utility — it
   silently loses. Where an override is genuinely wanted, it needs `!` (see the
   toolbar's `!text-accent`) — and wanting one usually means you picked the wrong
   class.
2. **Never hardcode a color, radius, size, or duration.** Three themes (plus
   charcoal) restate the tokens; a literal hex or px is invisible breakage in the
   other themes. If you type `#`, `rgba(`, or a px number that is not in this
   file, stop.

## Boxes (panels, cards, overlays)

| Surface | Class | Look |
|---|---|---|
| Toolbar, terminal panes, main views | `.floating-card` | radius-xl, 1px `--color-border`, `--surface-0`, **no shadow** (flat on purpose) |
| Sidebar chrome panels (launcher, switcher, side-panel bars) | `.launcher-panel` / `.sidebar-panel` | same material at 70% surface-0 |
| Menus, popovers, dropdowns, floating widgets | `.menu-surface` | radius-xl, border, surface-0, `--overlay-shadow` |
| Document-sized floaters (file preview, diff panel, palette) | `.menu-surface menu-surface--sheet` | same, heavier `--overlay-shadow-lg` |
| Modal dialogs | `.modal-card` (+ `.modal-pop` for motion, `.modal-scrim`) | radius-xl, border, surface-0, overlay-shadow-lg |

- A box's **contents sit 2px from its edge** (`.launcher-row` is `padding: 0 2px`;
  the message trail uses `px-0.5 py-0.5`). Controls fill the box; the box does not
  cushion them.
- Segments inside a bar are divided by `.launcher-sep` / `.panel-sep` (1px × 16px
  hairline), never by a full-height border.
- Radius nesting is arithmetic, not taste: a control inside a radius-xl panel uses
  `--radius-control` (7px = 10 − 3). Controls with no panel corner to answer to
  (dialog buttons, settings inputs, menu rows) use `--radius-lg`.

## Buttons

**Icon buttons — the decision is "what box does it sit in":**

| Where it sits | Class | Size / hover |
|---|---|---|
| Inside a panel, bar, or floating box (side panel path bar, terminal header, message trail, git bar) | `.panel-icon-btn` | 28px (`--control-h-md`) box, 16px icon (`w-4 h-4`), hover `--surface-100`, `data-active="true"` = accent tint (toggles), `:disabled` = 0.4 |
| The sidebar launcher row specifically | `.launcher-icon-btn` | identical look; launcher-local name |
| The app toolbar and standalone spots | `.btn-icon btn-icon-md` (also `-sm`/`-xs`) | fixed square per size, hover `--surface-200`, `:disabled` = 0.4 |

- The sizes are **boxes, not paddings** — a fixed square, glyph chosen to read
  well inside it: `w-4 h-4` (16px) in a 28px box, `w-3.5` in 24px, `w-3` in 20px.
- **Icons are Heroicons 24/outline. No hand-rolled SVGs** for standard glyphs
  (the old header X and stop-square were the last two; they're gone).
- Toggle state is `data-active="true"` on `.panel-icon-btn` (accent text + 12%
  accent fill) — never a color utility bolted on.
- Never add `hover:bg-*` to any of these; the class owns its hover.

**Text buttons:** `.btn-primary` (accent fill), `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-dialog`
(the Cancel/Confirm footer pair), `.launcher-btn` / `.panel-tab` /
`.group-switcher-chip` (28px chip: px-2, 12px text, hover surface-100, selected
surface-200). Disabled is always `opacity: 0.4` + `cursor: not-allowed`.

## Inputs and search

- `.input-field` — 32px (`--control-h-lg`), radius-lg, surface-100, subtle border,
  accent border on focus. `.textarea-field` is its multi-line twin.
- `.input-compact` — 28px, text-xs, accent ring on focus; add
  `.input-compact-icon-right` when a trailing glyph needs room (a `pr-*` utility
  will NOT work — see rule 1).
- `.search-field` — the in-panel search (sidebar, side panel): 28px, radius-control,
  translucent surface-100 fill, clear button `.search-field-clear`.

## Rows and lists

- Menu/popover rows: `.menu-item` (28px min, radius-lg, hover surface-100,
  `data-selected="true"` surface-200). Color variants are modifier classes on it,
  not text utilities.
- Sidebar rows: `.sidebar-item` (height `--sidebar-row-h` 32px, padding
  `--sidebar-row-px`, its own resting colors). Align any sidebar chrome to
  `--sidebar-gutter`, never to hand-picked padding.
- Side-panel tree rows: `--panel-row-h` (28px); git tree section rows
  `--git-tree-row-h` (30px); hairlines between blocks use `--rule-color` only.

## The ladder of grays (per theme, never literal)

`--surface-0` (panel ground) → `--surface-100` (hover in panels, input fills) →
`--surface-200` (selected / toolbar hover) → `--surface-300/400` (pressed, rare).
Text: `--text-primary` / `--text-secondary` / `--text-tertiary` (resting icon
color). Borders: `--color-border` (a panel's one structural border) →
`--border-subtle` (inner seams) → `--rule-color` (repeating list hairlines).
Accent: `--color-accent` — state and primary actions only, never decoration.

## Type and numbers

Geist Sans everywhere via `--font-sans`; `font-medium` resolves to 400 — do not
reach for 500/700. The working sizes: 13.5px sidebar rows, 13px menu rows and
dialog buttons, 12px chips/buttons/labels, 11px secondary lines and counters,
10px badges. Counters and anything columnar get `font-variant-numeric:
tabular-nums`.

## Motion

Color/background transitions are 150ms; press feedback is the shared 3% scale dip
on `--ease-out-expo` (buttons only, never rows). Overlays enter with
`.menu-pop` / `.menu-pop-mount` (140ms) or `.modal-pop` (160ms). Content
appearing/disappearing inside a box: Framer Motion, ~140–160ms, easeOut. Scrolling
a terminal programmatically glides (ease-out, duration scaled to distance, capped
400ms) — see `lib/terminal-scroll.ts`.

## Hover-revealed affordances

A control that only matters on approach (the trail's full-message chevron) is a
small overlay: 20px box, radius-control, ~90% surface-0 backdrop so it reads over
text, `opacity: 0 → 1` on the CONTAINER's hover, `pointer-events: none` until
shown. Place it where it cannot sit on another control's click center — Playwright
found the centered version stealing the message line's clicks before any human did.

## Checklist before you ship a control

- [ ] Its box size is a `--control-h-*` token and its radius answers its panel.
- [ ] Its class comes from this file; no `hover:bg-*`, no invented size.
- [ ] Icon is a Heroicon at the size paired with the box above.
- [ ] Toggle state uses `data-active` / `data-selected`, not a color utility.
- [ ] It looks right in dark AND light (and ideally coffee/charcoal).
- [ ] Disabled renders at 0.4 with no hover fill.

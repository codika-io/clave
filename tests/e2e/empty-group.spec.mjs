/**
 * An emptied group keeps its place.
 *
 * Closing a group's last tab used to make the group vanish with it: the user
 * opens a group, closes its one session, and cannot find the group again.
 * The group had not been deleted — it was in the store, hidden for holding
 * nothing, and pruned for good at the next launch. An empty group is a
 * normal state now, in the real app:
 *
 *  1. The card stays, its rail holding a "No sessions" row instead of the
 *     tab — and it is EXACTLY as tall as it was with one session, so nothing
 *     below it jumps when the last tab closes.
 *  2. The header still works: a click folds the empty card, another unfolds it.
 *  3. The row is the group's drop zone: a loose tab dragged onto it joins the
 *     group, and the row makes way for it.
 *  4. The next launch brings the empty group back, empty (the boot merge no
 *     longer prunes it).
 *
 * Fails if the old behaviour comes back at any of those four points: a card
 * that disappears, a card that shrinks to its header, a drop that does
 * nothing, or a group missing after the restart.

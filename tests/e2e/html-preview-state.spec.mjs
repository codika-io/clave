/**
 * A rendered HTML page SURVIVES being switched away from and back (PRDCT-2122).
 *
 * The bug: `TerminalGrid` rendered only the SELECTED file tabs, so deselecting an
 * .html tab unmounted its `FileViewer`, its `HtmlPreviewFrame`, and the iframe's
 * whole document. Coming back mounted a fresh one — a full reload. The scroll was
 * at the top again and every piece of state the page held (an open in-page tab, a
 * filter, a chart's zoom) was back to its initial value. Nothing errored; the page
 * just silently started over. The terminals one loop above have always done the
 * opposite — render all, hide the unselected — which is the only reason a terminal
 * survives a tab switch.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SPEC HAS TO ASSERT, and why the obvious check is worthless: "an iframe
 * is present after coming back" passes just as happily on the broken code, because
 * a remount also leaves an iframe in the DOM. So does "the src is right". The only
 * question that separates fixed from broken is whether it is the SAME LIVE
 * DOCUMENT, and there are two independent ways to see that from the parent, both
 * used below:
 *
 *   1. ELEMENT IDENTITY. Stamp an expando on the iframe element before switching
 *      away. React re-creates the DOM node on remount, so a surviving stamp means
 *      the element was never destroyed.
 *   2. LOAD COUNT. The `load` event fires on the iframe element and is observable
 *      cross-origin (the frame is an opaque origin — sandbox without
 *      allow-same-origin — so its scroll and its internals are NOT readable, which
 *      is exactly why the fix has to preserve the document rather than restore it).
 *      A document that reloaded fires load again. Still 1 means it never reloaded.
 *
 * Both are checked after a REAL tab switch driven through the store the sidebar
 * writes, and a CONTROL asserts the page genuinely reloads when it should (an
 * explicit reload bumps the count), so a counter wired to nothing cannot read as a
 * pass.
 *
 *   3. THE SCROLL OFFSET ITSELF. The app cannot read it, but the test driver can
 *      evaluate inside the frame, so the user-facing symptom is asserted directly
 *      on both surfaces (file tab and session view), not inferred from 1 and 2.
 *
 * MUTATION-TESTED against the pre-fix source (git checkout HEAD~1 on the layout
 * folder): 11 of these 28 assertions go red — identity, load count and scroll,
 * on both surfaces — and which ones STAY green is the point: "coming back, the
 * preview is there" and "at a usable size" pass on the broken code. Those are the
 * checks a spec written the obvious way would have made, and they would have
 * shipped the bug.
 *
 * What this spec does NOT pin down, deliberately, is the `visibility: hidden`
 * choice: swapping it for `display: none` leaves every assertion here green,
 * because Chromium keeps a display:none iframe's document and scroll alive too.
 * That choice is about the layout box (a frame with no box comes back needing a
 * re-layout, so a page that sizes itself on resize redoes that work every switch),
 * not about survival, and it is written down as such in TerminalGrid.tsx rather
 * than asserted here as something it is not.

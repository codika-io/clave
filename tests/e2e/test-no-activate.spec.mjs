/**
 * `--test-no-activate`: the app under automated test must not steal the focus
 * — nor the screen.
 *
 * An E2E run launches a second Electron instance on the same desktop a human is
 * working on. Without this flag every `ready-to-show` yanked the keyboard away
 * mid-sentence and dropped a second Clave icon in the Dock; with the first
 * version of the flag (`showInactive()`) the keyboard stayed put but every new
 * window still landed at the FRONT of the desktop, over the human's work. The
 * flag now makes the instance a macOS accessory whose windows are never shown
 * at all, with background throttling off so the hidden renderer keeps running.
 * `harness.mjs` passes it on every launch, so this spec asserts the harness's
 * own default rather than a special launch of its own.
 *
 * The load-bearing claims: no window is ever on screen, none is ever key, and
 * the driver can still work the app end to end (Playwright drives the renderer
 * over the debugger protocol; a hidden page with throttling off answers).
 * The `show` event is recorded on a second window opened AFTER the recorder is
 * installed: it must never fire.

/**
 * A group prompt edited in the `.clave` must reach the group (PRDCT-1665).
 *
 * The watcher's reload parsed the new prompt and then dropped it: `prompt` was
 * normalised but missing from both `updatePinnedGroup` calls it feeds. Every
 * other field reloaded, so you edited a lane's brief, watched the name change,
 * and the `+` went on dispatching agents on the old one. Nothing on screen was
 * wrong — the "demos perfectly and does nothing" shape.
 *
 * The group NAME is the control. A watcher that never fired, or fired too late,
 * fails both assertions and reads as infrastructure; only the prompt failing is
 * the regression. Without the control a flaky watcher looks like a prompt bug.
 *
 * What "reaches the group" means, precisely: a group already stamped out is a
 * SNAPSHOT — `spawnTemplate` is a stamp, its sessions and its brief are copied
 * at that moment and a later file edit does not reach back into a running group.
 * The reload's job is that the PIN carries the new brief, so the next group
 * stamped from it launches on what the file now says. That is what this asserts,
 * and it is the distinction the first version of this spec got wrong: it read
 * the name off the pin and the prompt off a group stamped before the edit, so it
 * compared two different things and blamed the code.

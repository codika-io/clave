/** Workspace registry — a LEAF store: plain state, no imports of the session
 *  or pinned stores (they import this one for stamping). All orchestration
 *  (activation side effects, add/remove cascades, persistence) lives in
 *  lib/workspace-actions.ts, which sits above every store.
 *
 *  Multi-window (PRDCT-1703): a window is the whole app once more, on
 *  whatever workspace the user put it on. `activeWorkspaceId` is the
 *  workspace THIS WINDOW shows — a per-window value handed to the renderer by
 *  main at boot, never read from the state file. The identity fields beside
 *  it say which window this is: its runtime id, its persisted key (the name
 *  of its own sidebar layout file, the stamp on the session records it
 *  opened), and whether it is the primary (the window that takes in what a
 *  closing window leaves and adopts orphans at boot).
 *
 *  Invariant: `activeWorkspaceId === null` ⟺ `workspaces.length === 0`.
 *  While workspaces exist, exactly one is always active in a window — there
 *  is no "deactivated" state. With zero workspaces the app runs unscoped and
 *  behaves as if the workspace feature didn't exist.

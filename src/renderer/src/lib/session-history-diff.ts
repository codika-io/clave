/**
 * The session ledger's diff (PRDCT-1738), store-free so the unit tests pin it.
 *
 * Every tab has a PLACEMENT IDENTITY — which group it sits in (and that
 * group's name), its own name, its transcript id, its workspace. Whenever a
 * tab's identity differs from the last one stamped, one `placed` row is sent;
 * when a tab leaves the state, one `closed` row with its last identity.
 * Diffing the state rather than hooking actions is the point: a drag into a
 * group, Cmd+G, an ungroup, a group deletion, an agent's clave_move_session,
 * a re-adoption after a restart all change the tuple and all land here
 * without being named — and they land AT THE MOVE, which the exchange-capture
 * stream (stamping the group as of the NEXT hook word) could not promise.
 *
 * Only TABS are stamped: the hidden halves (a group's quick-launch terminal,
 * a view's serving process) are in the store but in no group and not in the
 * display order, and they are nobody's history.

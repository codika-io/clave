/**
 * The one set of expanded folders the side panel's two tabs share.
 *
 * The Files tab and the Git tab draw the same folders and used to remember
 * them separately, so browsing to `labs/products/clave` in Git and switching to
 * Files landed you back at the root with the whole path to walk again. They are
 * one panel with two views; the folders you have open are a property of the
 * panel, not of whichever tab you happened to open them in.
 *
 * Two conversions make that possible, and they are the whole reason this file
 * exists rather than a bare `Set<string>` in the store:
 *
 * 1. **The two tabs speak different path languages.** The Files tree keys on
 *    paths RELATIVE to the panel folder (`labs/products` — `readDir` builds
 *    them that way, file-manager.ts), the Git repo tree on ABSOLUTE ones
 *    (`/Users/u/ws/labs/products` — buildRepoTree, git-repo-tree.ts). The
 *    shared set is relative, because that is the form that survives the panel
 *    being re-rooted onto a different folder: the same relative path means the
 *    same place in the tree, whatever it hangs from.
 *
 * 2. **They store opposite senses.** Files remembers what is EXPANDED, the Git
 *    repo tree what is COLLAPSED (its default was every folder open). Sharing
 *    one set means picking one sense and inverting at the Git edge, which
 *    `collapsedFromExpanded` does against that tree's own directory list.
 *
 * The sense the set carries is EXPANDED, because the two trees list different
 * folders. The Files tree shows every directory on disk; the Git tree shows
 * only those with a repository somewhere underneath. A set of expanded paths
 * mentions folders the other tab may not draw, and that is harmless — it is
 * ignored there and still correct when you come back. A set of COLLAPSED paths
 * could not do that: a folder the Git tree has never heard of is absent from
 * its set, which would read as "expanded" and silently open it.
 *
 * Pure functions over strings — no fs, no path module, no React — so the
 * mapping is unit-tested rather than inferred from the app's behaviour.

/**
 * Fold one Git-tree directory into the shared set, or unfold it.
 *
 * Folding is the exact inverse of expanding, and that is the whole difficulty.
 *
 * The Git tree's rows are COMPACTED chains: `labs/products` is one row when
 * nothing branches in between, and its path is the DEEPEST segment. Expanding
 * it has to open every segment on the way in, or the Files tab — which draws
 * `labs` and `products` as separate rows — cannot show the path at all. So
 * expand writes the ancestors.
 *
 * Fold must therefore take them back. A fold that removed only the leaf and
 * its subtree left `labs` in the set with nothing able to clear it: `labs` is
 * not a Git row of its own, so no click ever names it again. The Git row read
 * shut while the Files tab still drew the path open — precisely the
 * disagreement this module exists to prevent, in the direction it advertises.
 *
 * Clicking one row therefore shuts the whole chain it stands for: the path,
 * everything under it, and every folder above it. A row that reads as one
 * thing acts as one thing, and expand-then-fold returns the set to where it
 * started.

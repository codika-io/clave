 * What the launch does with each surviving session record — the rule that

 * sidebar (PRDCT-1756).
 *
 * The record is all that survives an app quit, and until `link` it did not
 * say what its session was FOR. So a group's `npm run dev`, a session view's
 * serving process and a toolbar button's dev server all came back as
 * top-level tabs: mystery rows next to the groups, while the owner showed
 * "not running" and its start action spawned a DUPLICATE on the same port.
 * The renderer's own links could not close the gap — the toolbar's lives in
 * a module map that dies with the window, the session view's is deliberately
 * never persisted, and the group's lives in the sidebar layout, which drops
 * it together with the group whose members did not come back.
 *
 * Pure so vitest pins it; the adoption itself is `adopt-record.ts`.

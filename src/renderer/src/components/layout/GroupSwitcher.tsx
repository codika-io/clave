/**
 * The group switcher: a panel under the session launcher listing every group the
 * workspace knows about — All, a chip per group, and the `+` for the full picker.
 *
 * "Knows about" is the important part, and it is what this got wrong at first.
 * The chips are drawn from the workspace's PINNED groups (the ones declared in
 * `.clave` and auto-discovered from the tree), not from the handful currently
 * spawned. A workspace declares dozens and runs three; a switcher that lists the
 * three can only ever take you where you already are. Live groups without a pin
 * are listed too, so nothing on screen is missing from it.
 *
 * A chip therefore does one of two things. Not running: spawn it, exactly as the
 * picker dialog does. Running: filter the sidebar list to it, and back to All on
 * a second click. Filtering touches the LIST only and leaves the terminals you
 * are looking at where they are.
 *
 * The search narrows the chips, so typing a group's name is how you reach one of
 * the dozens that is not on screen; the same query narrows the session list
 * below. Enter acts on the first chip left standing — and that chip carries the
 * hover state from the moment you type, without the pointer. Enter had no
 * visible target before: you typed, the chips reordered, and the only way to
 * know which one Enter would take was to press it. The highlight is that answer,
 * drawn where the answer is.
 *
 * Its top row is fixed — All, the field, the `+`. None of the three belongs to
 * the wrapping set: All is the filter's off position, the field is never
 * "selected" the way a chip is, and the `+` is the panel's action. Pinning them
 * also keeps them still while the chips below change under the search.
 *
 * The chip row under it is the only part that comes and goes: with nothing to
 * show it collapses away entirely rather than reserving a line for a placeholder,
 * and it opens on a height transition when the first chip arrives — starting a
 * group, or a search reaching past the running ones.
 *
 * Named "switcher", not "rail": .group-rail is the coloured bar down a group's
 * sessions in the list below.

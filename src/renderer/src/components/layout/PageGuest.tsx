/**
 * A page the reader browses, as an Electron web view: a guest with a history
 * of its own. It is what every view (a group's, a session's) and every .html
 * file opened as a page renders into — one frame, one trail, one link rule.
 *
 * The guest is hardened in the main process (no preload, no node, sandboxed,
 * every permission refused) and its links are policed there (view-guests.ts):
 * the local machine, the page's own origin or its own folder stay in the pane,
 * the wider web opens in the system browser. `allowpopups` is what lets a
 * popup REACH that policy: without it Chromium drops window.open and every
 * target="_blank" link on the floor before any handler runs — and the exos
 * pages open their tasks that way. With it, the guest's window-open handler
 * denies the window and hands the url to the system browser.
 *
 * The parent owns the trail state (`onTrail`) and drives the guest through the
 * handle; remounting is the parent's business too (a `key`), since a new
 * element is a new history. The tag's methods throw until the guest is
 * attached, and the element renders before that, so every call is guarded —
 * an unattached guest simply reads as "at home, nowhere to go".

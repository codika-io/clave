/**
 * The expandable note shared by the sidebar's two announcement cards.
 *
 * Both cards had the same problem from opposite ends. The what's-new card
 * printed the whole release note — several paragraphs — at a user who had not
 * asked; the update card asked for a 220 MB download and a restart while naming
 * only a version number. One answer serves both: the card is a headline at
 * rest, and the changelog is one click under it.
 *
 * Collapsed is the default in both. The rest state of an announcement is a
 * single line — a card that opens itself is the unbounded card again, just with
 * a chevron on it.
 *
 * The height cap survives expansion and is the reason this is a component
 * rather than a `<details>`. These cards live in the sidebar's `flex-shrink-0`
 * announcements block: an unbounded one pushes the session list and the foot
 * panel off the bottom of the window with nothing to scroll (the bug
 * `tests/e2e/sidebar-whats-new.spec.mjs` was written for). Expanded means the
 * note is readable in place, scrolled inside its own box — never that the card
 * is free to grow.
 *
 * **The trigger and the note are returned as separate elements, and a caller
 * must not wrap them in one flex row.** The trigger usually shares a row with
 * a sibling control ("Try it"); the note underneath needs the card's full
 * width. Putting both in that row makes the row a flex parent of the note too,
 * which lays the paragraphs out in a narrow column beside the chevron — a
 * layout bug no assertion about height or scrolling can see, because the box is
 * still capped and still scrolls. Render `trigger` inside the row and `note`
 * after it, as a sibling of the row.

/**
 * "What's in this update", as a mark on the update icon rather than as a fold
 * in the card.
 *
 * The disclosure this replaces lived inside the update banner, which put the
 * changelog in the same box as the two decisions the card exists for — Later
 * and Update. Reading it grew the card, pushed the buttons down, and made an
 * announcement nobody asked for into the tallest thing in the sidebar. The
 * changelog is *reference*, not part of the choice: it belongs beside the card,
 * on demand, and gone again the moment the pointer leaves.
 *
 * Hover opens it and click pins it. Both, because the two uses differ: a glance
 * at what changed wants no click at all, while following a link in a note (or
 * scrolling three releases of them) needs the panel to stay put while the
 * pointer travels to it. A pinned panel is dismissed by the badge again, by
 * Escape, or by clicking away.
 *
 * The delays are the anti-flicker pair: 120ms before opening, so crossing the
 * icon on the way somewhere else opens nothing, and 200ms before closing, so
 * the gap between the badge and the panel can be crossed.
 *
 * The badge is an `Anchor`, not a `Trigger`, on purpose. Radix's trigger owns
 * the click and toggles from its own idea of `open` — which, once hover has
 * already opened the panel, is the opposite of what the click means: clicking
 * to PIN a hover-opened panel would close it. Anchoring keeps positioning and
 * gives the click one owner, and `onInteractOutside` is taught to ignore the
 * badge so a click there is not also an outside-dismiss.

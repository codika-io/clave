/**
 * A canvas painted with one Antasphere field — gradient, optional veil, film
 * grain. Sizes itself to whatever box it is put in and repaints on resize, so
 * the caller only ever sets CSS dimensions.
 *
 * `groundLift` is how a field is quietened: how far off the app's own surface
 * the finished ground may sit, in luminance. A wash of that surface is laid
 * over the gradient BEFORE the grain — solved, not fixed, so Basalt and
 * Glacier land at the same value and differ only in hue — and the noise then
 * arrives at full strength. Never fade this canvas with CSS opacity to the
 * same end: that fades the grain too, and a field without its grain is a grey
 * smear. The surface is read from `--surface-0` at paint time, which is why
 * the component watches the theme: the wash has to follow the app.
 *
 * Still by construction: the console animates its fields on a drift clock, and
 * a drifting gradient at the foot of a sidebar you look at all day is a
 * distraction rather than a signature.

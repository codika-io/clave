/**
 * Where a link followed inside a view goes.
 *
 * A view (a group's or a session's attached page) is an Electron web view with
 * a history of its own. The page can link anywhere; this is the one rule that
 * decides whether a link stays in the pane (and joins the trail the back and
 * forward arrows walk) or leaves for the system browser. It lives apart from
 * the main-process wiring so both outcomes stay testable without a window:
 *
 *  - `in-pane`: the target is on the local machine (a loopback host — another
 *    exos page on another port, a sibling dev server) or on the origin the view
 *    started on (an https dashboard navigating within itself). Home is always
 *    one click away, so wandering here is safe.
 *  - `external`: any other http(s) URL. The pane is a place, not a browser;
 *    a link to the wider web opens where the user's bookmarks and sessions are,
 *    exactly as a popup from the page already does.
 *  - `deny`: anything that is not http(s) — a custom scheme, `file:`, `javascript:`.
 *    Nothing in a view may reach the app's own protocols or the disk.

/**
 * The local machine, by ADDRESS, never by name shape. The URL parser hands us a
 * canonical hostname (`0x7f000001` and `2130706433` both arrive as
 * `127.0.0.1`, an IPv4-mapped IPv6 loopback as `[::ffff:7f00:1]`), so the
 * whole 127/8 block is one dotted-quad test. A public name that merely starts
 * with `127.` (`127.0.0.1.nip.io`, `127.example.com`) is NOT local: wildcard
 * DNS resolves it wherever its owner likes, and a string prefix would have let
 * it into the pane. `localhost` and its subdomains are loopback by RFC 6761.

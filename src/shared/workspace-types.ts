/** Workspace model shared between main and renderer.
 *
 * A workspace is a ROOT FOLDER (e.g. ~/.antasphere), not a .clave file: each
 * workspace carries one chosen profile file (.clave/workspaces/<name>.clave)
 * that defines its pinned groups and toolbar. Each WINDOW shows one workspace
 * at a time and scopes everything visible in it (sessions, groups, pins,
 * toolbar); a window's `activeWorkspaceId === null` if and only if no
 * workspaces are registered (the app then behaves as if the feature didn't
 * exist). Any number of windows may show the same workspace: a window is the
 * whole app once more, on whatever workspace the user picks for it.
